To perform a Explicit Dynamics analysis of Shaper Mechanism.
Compare the result of Total deformation, Equivalent stress ,Force.
Analyzing the result and developing the interference with different velocity.
Higher the velocity of the cutting tool, lower will be stress developed.
lower effort required for higher cutting speed.
